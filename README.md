## RDP Password Attacker  
Terminator is an RDP password attack tool which uses Impacket's rdp_check.py example. It will take a list of hosts, usernames and passwords or a single one of each.  
Terminator will also take a single NTLM hash, or list of hashes for authentication (Pass the hash).

./terminator.rb --help should tell you all you need to know.
